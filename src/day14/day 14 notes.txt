- array
per step
- clone array 
  per insertion (NN)
  - determine in old array all places where char + char+1 = = N + N 
- do all insertions  
  - insert per char in new array. How to determine correct place to insert? index to insert and than increase per insertion if previous insertion lower index

use set to create unique elements. per element use filter + length	

NNCB
The first pair (NN) matches the rule NN -> C, so element C is inserted between the first N and the second N.
NCNCB
  =
  
The second pair (NC) matches the rule NC -> B, so element B is inserted between the N and the C.
Note that it is NOT inserted in the NC that was created above
NCNBCB
   = 
   
The third pair (CB) matches the rule CB -> H, so element H is inserted between the C and the B.
